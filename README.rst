# PyNvVideoCodec

[PyNvVideoCodec](https://docs.nvidia.com/video-technologies/pynvvideocodec/index.html) is NVIDIA’s Python based video codec library for hardware accelerated video encode and decode on NVIDIA GPUs. PyNvVideoCodec is the successor of [VPF](https://github.com/NVIDIA/VideoProcessingFramework) (Video Processing Framework).  

The library is distributed under MIT license and is officially supported by NVIDIA. PyNvVideoCodec library internally uses Video Codec SDK’s core C/C++ video encode and decode APIs and provides easy to use Python APIs on it. The library offers encode and decode performance close to Video Codec SDK.



 

## Features
Current PyNvVideoCodec version supports following features:

* Codecs: H.264, HEVC, AV1.
* Surface formats: NV12 (8 bit), YUV 4:2:0 (10 bit), YUV 4:4:4 (8 and 10 bit)
* Video  container formats:  MP4, AVI and MKV
* DLPack support to facilitate data exchange with popular DL frameworks like PyTorch and TensorRT.
* CUDA Array Interface support to facilitate data exchange with NVIDIA's CV-CUDA library.
* CUDA stream support for optimizing throughput.
* Contains Python sample applications demonstrating API usage.


## Distribution
PyNvVideoCodec library is distributed in two formats: binary distribution via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pynvvideocodec/)  and source code distribution via [NVIDIA NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/resources/pynvvideocodec). In both cases, the library and its dependencies can be installed using a single pip install command.

This package on PyPI contains Python WHLs of PyNvVideoCodec library. To install this library please open the shell prompt, and run the following command.
```
$ pip install PyNvVideoCodec
```
